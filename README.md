Geoglance is a user-friendly web application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to explore and find detailed information about countries worldwide easily.

Using the Rest Countries API, you can search for any country to discover key facts like its population, region, currency, and language. I am also planning to add more features in the future. The app also automatically employs reverse geocoding to detect users' countries, providing a personalized experience.

With these features, Geoglance serves as a valuable resource for students, travelers, and anyone looking to learn more about different cultures and places around the globe.
